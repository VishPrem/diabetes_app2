There isnâ€™t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help in reducing the impact of diabetes. This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has diabetes or is prone to get diabetes in the future by analyzing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.")
